     * B�zout's identity (also called B�zout's lemma) is a theorem in the elementary theory of numbers:
     * 
     * let a and b be nonzero integers and let d be their greatest common divisor. Then there exist integers x and y such that
     * ax+by=d
     * 
     * In addition, the greatest common divisor d is the smallest positive integer that can be written as ax + by
     * 
     * every integer of the form ax + by is a multiple of the greatest common divisor d. If a or b is negative this means we are
     * emptying a jug of x or y gallons respectively.
     * 
     * Similarly if a or b is positive this means we are filling a jug of x or y gallons respectively.
     * 
     * x = 4, y = 6, z = 8.
     * 
     * GCD(4, 6) = 2
     * 
     * 8 is multiple of 2
     * 
     * so this input is valid and we have:
     * 
     * -1 * 4 + 6 * 2 = 8
     * 
     * In this case, there is a solution obtained by filling the 6 gallon jug twice and emptying the 4 gallon jug once. (Solution.
     * Fill the 6 gallon jug and empty 4 gallons to the 4 gallon jug. Empty the 4 gallon jug. Now empty the remaining two gallons
     * from the 6 gallon jug to the 4 gallon jug. Next refill the 6 gallon jug. This gives 8 gallons in the end)
     *

     * 
     * and comments in the code
